# Synthesizing Infomap

This repository contains an adapted version of the [Infomap Software Package](https://github.com/mapequation/infomap) (see also see [www.mapequation.org](http://www.mapequation.org)) and a set of examples and experiments, created in the course of the [Synthesizing Infomap Master's Thesis](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4446856).


Getting started:
--------------------------------------------------------
In a terminal with the GNU Compiler Collection installed, just run `make` in the current directory to compile the,code with the included `Makefile`. Call `./Infomap` to run. Run `./Infomap --help` for a list of available options.

Our experiments can be found [here](examples/python/altmap).
